# Java-Mandelbrot
Mandelbrot viewer implemented in Java

To zoom, click first on the bottom left of the rectangle you want to zoom in on, then click the top right of the box.

# TODO
- Make zooming only be in squares to fix weird proportion stuff
- Make zooming independent of which corner you click first
